`And now you are mine现在,你是我的

　　And now you are mine.

　　现在,你是我的

　　Rest with your dream in my dream.

　　在我的梦境中沉沉入梦

　　Love and pain and work should all sleep now.

　　爱痛与辛劳也全休眠。

　　The night turns on its invisible wheels,

　　夜色苍茫,身旁的你

　　And you are pure beside me as a sleeping amber.

　　那么纯洁,如同静静的琥珀。

　　No one else, love, will sleep in my dreams.

　　再没有人,亲爱的,会在我的梦境中沉睡。

　　You will go, we will go together,

　　你会离去,我们一块儿离去,

　　over the waters of time.

　　跨越时间的长河。

　　No one else will travel through the shadows with me.

　　再没有人会与我并肩穿越这黑暗,

　　Only you, Evergreen, Ever sun, Ever moon.

　　只有你,是我常青的树,不灭的太阳,不落的月亮。

　　Your hands have already opened their delicate fists

　　你舒展的柔美纤指,

　　And let their soft drifting sorrows drop away.

　　缓缓淌落了悲伤。

　　Your eyes close like two great wings, and I move.

　　你双眸拢合如翼,我动身了。

　　After, following the folding water

　　随后,载着你的冥流,

　　that you carry, that carries me away.

　　也将载我离去,

　　The night, the world, the wind spin out their destiny.

　　黑夜、世界和风,循入它们的命运,

　　Without you, I am your dream, only that, and that is all.

　　失去了你,我只是你的梦幻,只是这样。`
